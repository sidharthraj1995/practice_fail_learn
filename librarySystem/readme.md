# Library Management System in C++

### Designing a Library Management System involves breaking down the system into various components and defining their interactions. Here's a high-level system design for a simple library management system:

1. **Entities:**
   - Book: Contains information about the book such as title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
   - Member: Represents library members with details like name, member ID, and borrowed books.
   - Library: Manages books and members, providing functions to add, search, and borrow books.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - Book Structure: A structure to store book details like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
   - Member Structure: A structure to store member details like name, member ID, and a list of borrowed books.

3. **Operations:**
   - Add a Book: Allows the librarian to add a new book to the library with its details.
   - Search for a Book: Enables users to search for a book by its title or author and get the availability status.
   - Borrow a Book: Members can borrow a book if it is available and update the book's status and member's records accordingly.
   - Return a Book: Members can return a borrowed book, updating the book's availability and removing it from the member's record.
   - Display All Books: Shows a list of all books in the library with their details.
   - Display All Members: Displays a list of all library members along with their borrowed books.

4. **Classes:**
   - Book Class: Contains functions to set and get book details like title, author, ISBN, and availability status.
   - Member Class: Contains functions to manage member details like name, member ID, borrowed books, and operations to borrow and return books.
   - Library Class: Contains a collection of Book and Member objects, providing functions to add books, search for books, and manage borrowing and returning operations.

5. **User Interface:**
   - The user interface can be simple console-based or graphical, depending on the complexity you want to add. For a basic system, a console-based interface is sufficient.

6. **Data Storage:**
   - You can use data structures to store books and members in memory during runtime. If you want to persist data even after the program exits, you can use file handling to read/write data to a file.

Remember that this is a basic design for a simple library management system. In real-world scenarios, you would have more complex requirements like database integration, authentication, transaction handling, and scalability. As a beginner, this design should be a good starting point for your project, and you can enhance it further as you gain more experience.
